# Selenium-Example
A GITP forum harvester
The code is a Selenium project which given a correct URL will navigate to the 1st page of any 1 GITP forum thread and harvest the name, time, and text of all posts in a thread.
This was created for me to practice Selenium and give someone an example of what it can do. Other uses of Selenium might be a forum bot with a basic ML backend, automated
testing of a browser based software product or even an an automated web agent which doesn't require sleep for stuff like finding unusual things or clicking things if 
time is of the essence.
